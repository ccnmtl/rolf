{"name":"Rolf","body":"# Rolf is a web based deployment tool\r\n\r\nRolf is aimed at letting you deploy an application to production (or\r\nstaging, or wherever) in one step. If your deployment takes more than\r\none step, you're doing it wrong. \r\n\r\nA typical deployment process will checkout a clean copy of your\r\napplication code, tag it (for easy rollbacks later), copy the code to\r\nthe production server, update/build any dependencies needed, and\r\nrestart or HUP a server process on the production server. \r\n\r\nA deployment in Rolf consists of a collection of settings (eg,\r\nrepository URL, production host, target directory) and a list of\r\nstages that will be run in order, halting if any of the stages fail. \r\n\r\nUsers can log in to Rolf and hit the big \"push\" button for a\r\ndeployment. The stages each run, logging all the commands executed and\r\nthe STDOUT and STDERR returned. If a push ever fails, or broken code\r\ngets pushed to production, it's easy to go back through the Rolf\r\npushes to select a previous one that was successful and hit a\r\n\"rollback\" button and Rolf will run a deployment with that version of\r\ncode to get your application back to a running state as soon as\r\npossible.  \r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n* very simple interface, makes it hard to mess up a deployment\r\n* Category/Application/Deployment hierarchy\r\n* Deployment Stages can be written in Bash or Python\r\n* Stages can be shared across applications/deployments and browsed in\r\n  a \"cookbook\"\r\n* basic permissions model so you can let users push/rollback an\r\n  application without necessarily having the ability to modify the\r\n  deployment steps or settings (handy to let designers push)\r\n* drag and drop reordering of stages\r\n* easy rollback to a known good state\r\n* interactive step by step push mode for debugging your deployment\r\n* easy to \"clone\" a deployment\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n![All Apps Listing](https://github.com/ccnmtl/rolf/raw/master/doc/screenshots/rolf_all_apps.png)\r\n\r\n![A Push in Progress](https://github.com/ccnmtl/rolf/raw/master/doc/screenshots/rolf_pushing.png)\r\n\r\n![Stages of a Deployment](https://github.com/ccnmtl/rolf/raw/master/doc/screenshots/rolf_stages2.png)\r\n\r\n![Cookbook](https://github.com/ccnmtl/rolf/raw/master/doc/screenshots/rolf_cookbook.png)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nPlease see the [wiki](https://github.com/ccnmtl/rolf/wiki) for\r\ninstructions on installing, configuring, and using Rolf. \r\n","tagline":"Web Based Deployment Tool","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
