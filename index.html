        <h1>Rolf is a web based deployment tool</h1>

<p>Rolf is aimed at letting you deploy an application to production (or
staging, or wherever) in one step. If your deployment takes more than
one step, you're doing it wrong. </p>

<p>A typical deployment process will checkout a clean copy of your
application code, tag it (for easy rollbacks later), copy the code to
the production server, update/build any dependencies needed, and
restart or HUP a server process on the production server. </p>

<p>A deployment in Rolf consists of a collection of settings (eg,
repository URL, production host, target directory) and a list of
stages that will be run in order, halting if any of the stages fail. </p>

<p>Users can log in to Rolf and hit the big "push" button for a
deployment. The stages each run, logging all the commands executed and
the STDOUT and STDERR returned. If a push ever fails, or broken code
gets pushed to production, it's easy to go back through the Rolf
pushes to select a previous one that was successful and hit a
"rollback" button and Rolf will run a deployment with that version of
code to get your application back to a running state as soon as
possible.  </p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>very simple interface, makes it hard to mess up a deployment</li>
<li>Category/Application/Deployment hierarchy</li>
<li>Deployment Stages can be written in Bash or Python</li>
<li>Stages can be shared across applications/deployments and browsed in
a "cookbook"</li>
<li>basic permissions model so you can let users push/rollback an
application without necessarily having the ability to modify the
deployment steps or settings (handy to let designers push)</li>
<li>drag and drop reordering of stages</li>
<li>easy rollback to a known good state</li>
<li>interactive step by step push mode for debugging your deployment</li>
<li>easy to "clone" a deployment</li>
