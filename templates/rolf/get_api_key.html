<h2>Get API Key</h2>

<p>This key is for your IP Address ({{remote_addr}}):</p>
<pre>{{k1}}</pre>

<p>If you are on a dynamic connection, use this key instead which is
	valid for 1-week (then you'll have to log in and come back here to
	get a new one. Sorry, best we can do)</p>

<pre>{{k2}}</pre>

<p>If you don't understand what that means, back away slowly. You
	probably shouldn't be in here.</p>
